# Module-2-Assignment
Module 2 Assignment was running VBA code through three years of stock data. 

I had help from AskBCS to help determine how to properly find the right cell to use as the "start" variable. I also sought help to figure out how to print the code to the summary table. I found the formula to format the percentage column from excelcampus.com. I also went over my code with a tutor, Alysia, to figure out why my code was erroring out. When we couldn't figure it out, I went to offie hours and Pooja and other cohort members helped figure out small errors I had not noticed.
